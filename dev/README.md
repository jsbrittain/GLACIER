# Testing

Run `npm test` to execute the unit test suite, which also produces coverage reports.

End-to-end tests are managed by playright, run `npx playwright test` to execute them. This will test both the electron build and the client-server build. You can run playright in UI mode by appending the `--ui` flag.
